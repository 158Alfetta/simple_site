title: Making a jekyll-free site
---

If you want a plain website without all of this
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)/[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
business, you just need to fill the repository with plain html and css
and avoid directory names that start with underscores.

If you want some directories with underscores, just include a file
names `.nojekyll`. You might just include that anyway.  See the
[source for my kbroman.github.io](http://github.com/kbroman/kbroman.github.io)
site.
