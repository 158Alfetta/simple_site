title: Overview of GitHub Pages
---

The present site is close to the simplest possible. It has a
particular style (using
[Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)). And my first rule for
minimizing effort is _Modify your desires to match the defaults._

These GitHub Pages sites are constructed by having a `gh-pages` branch
of a GitHub repository, with specific files layed out in a specific
way. To see the structure of such a repository, look at the
[repository for the present site](http://github.com/kbroman/simple_site).
