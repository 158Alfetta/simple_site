[Github Pages](http://pages.github.com) provide a simple way to make a
web site using Markdown and git.

The sites use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a ruby gem, to convert
Markdown files to html and css, and this part is done automatically
when you push the materials to a GitHub repository. 

The [GitHub](http://pages.github.com) and
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) documentation is great, but I thought it
would be useful to have a minimal tutorial, for those who just want to
get going immediately with a simple site. To some readers, what GitHub
has might be simpler and more direct. But if you just want to create
a site like the one you're looking at now, read on.

\[Read on, once I fill this out.\]
